# remoteBash
Project is generated by ```rpcgen -a -C remoteBash.x``` command.

## Concept
I am using C background function popen where I pass command from client.

## Usage
First use ```make -f Makefile.remoteBash``` command to build project.

Next, you have to run server by ```sudo ./remoteBash_server```.  

Client is running in 2 modes: 1 command executed(1) or endless loop (2)  
1. ```sudo ./remoteBash_client localhost 'command' ```  
2. ```sudo ./remoteBash_client localhost``` and then you in loop: ``` command_to_execute``` ex. ```ls``` or ```cat remote*.c```.  
To end simply hit Ctrl + C.

## Problems
RPC needs to be running in system.
To check whether it is running execute ```rpcinfo```.  
On debian following packages needs to be installed: ```rpcbind nfs-common```
