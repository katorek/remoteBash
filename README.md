# remoteBash
Project is generated by ```rpcgen -a -C remoteBash.x``` command.

## Concept
I am using C background function popen where I pass command from client.
The pros of this solution is the fact that popen creates process with stream that returns standard output which I can return back to client. The only downside of usage this function is impossibility to pass standard input to this execution by server. This function is not implemented in remote-bash application.

The general idea was to run client and type any string based command like in real bash. Send command (C++ string) as parameter of remote server call. Server perform command (if it's possible) and return result (as string) and execution status (as int), it command execution failed it returns status 1 and error message. Client take results and print it.

## Usage
First use ```make -f Makefile.remoteBash``` command to build project.

Next, you have to run server by ```sudo ./remoteBash_server```.

And you can call any command you want by ```sudo ./remoteBash_client localhost ["cat remoteBash.x"] ```.

Where first argument of execution is host and second is command which you want to remotely execute (as string) which is optional.
If you dont provide second command program will execute in loop where u can provide multiple commands. To terminate the program simply hit Ctrl + C
