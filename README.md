# remoteBash
Project is generated by ```rpcgen -a -C remoteBash.x``` command.

## Concept
I am using C background function popen where I pass command from client.

## Usage
First use ```make -f Makefile.remoteBash``` command to build project.

Next, you have to run server by ```sudo break./remoteBash_server```.

And you can call any command you want by ```sudo ./remoteBash_client localhost ["cat remoteBash.x"] ```.

Where first argument of execution is host and second is command which you want to remotely execute (as string) which is optional.
If you dont provide second command program will execute in loop where u can provide multiple commands. To terminate the program simply hit Ctrl + C 

## Problems
RPC needs to be running in system.
To check whether it is running execute ```rpcinfo```.
On debian following packages needs to be installed: ```rpcbind nfs-common```
